## Installation

### For Project-wide Use (Team)

Copy these files to your project's `.claude/commands/` directory:

```bash
# Create commands directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .claude/commands

# Copy command files
cp 01-slash-commands/*.md .claude/commands/

# Copy subdirectory commands
cp -r 01-slash-commands/docs .claude/commands/
```

### For Personal Use

Copy to your personal Claude commands directory:

```bash
# Create personal commands directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands

# Copy command files
cp 01-slash-commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/
```

## Creating Your Own Commands

### Basic Command Template

Create a file `.claude/commands/my-command.md`:

```markdown
---
name: My Command Name
description: What this command does
tags: category, task-type
---

# Command Title

Instructions for Claude:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

Output format:
- How to format the response
- What to include
```

### Command with Frontmatter

```markdown
---
name: Code Optimization
description: Analyze code for performance issues and suggest optimizations
tags: performance, analysis
---

# Code Optimization

Review the provided code for the following issues in order of priority:

1. **Performance bottlenecks** - identify O(n²) operations, inefficient loops
2. **Memory leaks** - find unreleased resources, circular references
3. **Algorithm improvements** - suggest better algorithms or data structures

Format your response with:
- Issue severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Location in code
- Explanation
- Recommended fix with code example
```

## Best Practices

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|------|---------|
| Use clear, action-oriented names | Create commands for one-time tasks |
| Document trigger words in description | Build complex logic in commands |
| Keep commands focused on single task | Create redundant commands |
| Version control project commands | Hardcode sensitive information |
| Organize in subdirectories | Create long lists of commands |
| Use simple, readable prompts | Use abbreviated or cryptic wording |

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Task Automation

**File:** `.claude/commands/test.md`

```markdown
---
name: Run Tests
description: Execute test suite with coverage report
---

# Test Runner

1. Run the test suite: `npm test`
2. Generate coverage report
3. Summarize results
4. Highlight any failures
```

### Example 2: Multi-step Workflow

**File:** `.claude/commands/deploy.md`

```markdown
---
name: Deploy to Production
description: Complete deployment workflow with checks
---

# Production Deployment

Execute these steps in order:

1. **Pre-deployment checks**
   - Run `npm run lint`
   - Run `npm test`
   - Check git status is clean

2. **Build**
   - Run `npm run build`
   - Verify build artifacts

3. **Deploy**
   - Run `npm run deploy`
   - Monitor deployment logs

4. **Post-deployment**
   - Run smoke tests
   - Verify deployment
   - Notify team
```

### Example 3: Code Review Command

**File:** `.claude/commands/review.md`

```markdown
---
name: Code Review
description: Comprehensive code review checklist
---

# Code Review

Review the code for:

## Security
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Input validation present
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] XSS prevention

## Performance
- [ ] No N+1 queries
- [ ] Appropriate indexing
- [ ] Efficient algorithms

## Quality
- [ ] Clear naming
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Adequate comments
- [ ] No code duplication
```

## Advanced Usage

### Using Arguments

Commands can accept arguments:

```bash
/deploy production
/review --verbose
/test --coverage
```

Handle arguments in your command file:

```markdown
# Deployment Command

Check the provided argument for environment:
- If "production", use strict checks
- If "staging", allow warnings
- If "development", skip certain validations
```

### Integrating with MCP

Commands can use MCP tools:

```markdown
# GitHub PR Command

1. Use MCP to list open PRs: `/mcp__github__list_prs`
2. Analyze each PR for:
   - Review status
   - CI/CD status
   - Merge conflicts
3. Provide summary
```

### Hierarchical Commands

Organize related commands in subdirectories:

```
.claude/commands/
├── deploy/
│   ├── production.md
│   ├── staging.md
│   └── rollback.md
├── test/
│   ├── unit.md
│   ├── integration.md
│   └── e2e.md
└── docs/
    ├── api.md
    └── readme.md
```

Access with: `/deploy/production`, `/test/unit`, `/docs/api`

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found

**Problem:** Claude doesn't recognize `/my-command`

**Solutions:**
- Check file is in `.claude/commands/` directory
- Verify filename matches command name
- Restart Claude Code session
- Check file has `.md` extension

### Command Not Executing as Expected

**Problem:** Command loads but doesn't work correctly

**Solutions:**
- Review command prompt clarity
- Add more specific instructions
- Include examples in command file
- Test with simple inputs first

### Personal vs Project Commands

**When to use personal commands:**
- Personal preferences/workflows
- Not relevant to team
- Experimental commands
- Cross-project shortcuts

**When to use project commands:**
- Team standards
- Project-specific workflows
- Shared conventions
- Onboarding helpers
